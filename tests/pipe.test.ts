/**
 * The pipe guard, tested the way it broke.
 *
 * `... | head -1` closes the reader after the first line. Without an error
 * listener on stdout the next write raises an unhandled EPIPE event: Node
 * prints a stack trace and exits non-zero, so a caller that only wanted the
 * first line saw a crash where the command had actually succeeded.
 *
 * The child below has its read end closed before the first byte is written, so
 * the very next write fails -- there is no timing luck in the assertion. Both
 * directions are covered: a normal run must exit 0, and a run that legitimately
 * fails must keep its own exit code instead of being turned into a crash.
